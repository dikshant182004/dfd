# Getting Started with PyCharm: A Comprehensive Guide
## INTRODUCTION :-
With Jupyter Notebook integration available in PyCharm , you can easily edit, execute, and debug notebook source code and examine execution outputs including stream data, images, and other media.

Notebook support in `PyCharm` includes:

- Coding assistance:
- Error and syntax highlighting.
- Code completion.
- Ability to create line comments Ctrl0/.
- Ability to run cells and preview execution results.
- Dedicated `Jupyter Notebook` Debugger.
- Shortcuts for basic operations with Jupyter notebooks.
- Ability to recognize .ipynb files and mark them with the ipynb file icon icon.

## Jumpstart Your Jupyter Notebook Experience in PyCharm

To start working with Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm:
-Set Up Your Environment:
-Create a new Python project.
-Specify a virtual environment.
-Install the Jupyter package.
-Open or Create a Notebook:
-Open an existing `.ipynb` file or create a new one.
-Edit and Add Cells:
-Add and edit source cells in the notebook as needed.
-Execute Code Cells:

Execute any of the code cells to start the `Jupyter server` and run your code.

## Get familiar with the user interface

Mind the following user interface features when working with Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm.

Jupyter Notebook Interface Overview:

-Jupyter Notebook Toolbar: This toolbar provides quick access to frequently used actions. While additional notebook-specific actions are available in the` Cell menu`, this toolbar offers convenient shortcuts for common tasks.
-Code Cell: A code cell within the notebook is where you write and execute executable code. These cells are where you input your Python code for `analysis, calculations, or data manipulation.`
-Cell Output: After executing a code cell, the results are displayed in the` cell output area`. This output can take various forms, including text, tables, or plots, depending on the code's purpose and the libraries used.
-Cell Toolbar: The cell toolbar, typically hidden by default, contains essential commands for managing code cells. To enable this toolbar, navigate to Project Settings `(Ctrl+Alt+S)`, go to Languages & Frameworks | Jupyter, and check the "Show cell toolbar" option. Once enabled, it provides shortcuts and options for working with code cells efficiently.

## Cell toolbarï»¿
Each code cell has its configurable toolbar so that you can easily access the most popular commands and actions. By default, `cell toolbars` are disabled. To enable them, open project Settings `(Ctrl+Alt+S)`, go to Languages & Frameworks | Jupyter, and select the Show cell toolbar checkbox.

/>                  |Run Cell           | Executes the code cell. You can also press Ctrl+Enter to run the code cell.                |
| <img/>                   |Run Cell and Select Below | Executes this cell and selects the cell below. Press Shift+Enter to perform the same action. |
| Move Cell Up       | Moves the current cell up.                                |
| Move Cell Down     | Moves the current cell down.                              |
| Delete Cell        | Deletes the current cell.                                  |
| More Options       | Open the list of additional actions:                      |
|                    | - Run All Above: Executes all cells that preceded the selected cell.                     |
|                    | - Debug Cell: Runs the Debugger for the current cell. You should set a breakpoint first. Click the gutter next to the line where you want to stop. |
|                    | - Merge Cell Above: Merges the current cell with the cell above.                           |
|                    | - Merge Cell Below: Merges the current cell with the cell below.                           |
|                    | - Split Cell: Splits the current cell by the selected code line.                            |
|                    | - Convert Cell to Code: Converts the current cell into a code cell.                         |
|                    | - Convert Cell to Markdown: Converts the current cell into a Markdown cell.                 |
